Performance Analysis of Optimization Methods

  1) Various deterministic and non-deterministic optimization techniques were compared for their performance.
  
  2) Bench Mark Problems:
  
      a) Traveling Salesman Problem and 
      b) Speed Reducer Problem.
  
  3) GA + SQP (GA Hybrid) emerged out as the most efficient optimization technique.
